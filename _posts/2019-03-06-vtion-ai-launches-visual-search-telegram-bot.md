Vtion.ai is bringing visual search for fashon closer to everyone. Starting to, we launch our visual search Telegram Bot, Vtion Sense. You can now search products online by chatting with Vtion Sense on Telegram.

We find that people come across fashion items they like either on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp statuses or while walking down the street. They want to buy these fashion items but have no clue where and how to get them. We assume this happens to you everyday or probably right now. 

Welcome Vtion Sense, the first Telegram Visual Search bot that allows you to search with photos or even screenshots from Instagram. Simply send the picture of fashion outfit you're interested in and Vtion Sense would immediately search through the product catalogs of our publishers and return similar/matching items. From a single click buy immediately.

To chat with Vtion Sense, download Telegram, search & add Vtion Sense as a contact, and start searching. It's that easy.

If you are into retail fashion and interested in putting your products on Vtion Sense, we will be opening the platform up help more retailers reach their customers faster in the coming weeks. Or [click here]() to join the waiting list.

Vtion Sense awaits you!!!

Happy shopping
