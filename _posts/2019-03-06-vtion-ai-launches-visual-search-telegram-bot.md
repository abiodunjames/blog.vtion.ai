Vtion.ai is bringing visual search for fashion closer to everyone. Starting today, we launch our visual search [Telegram Bot](https://telegram.org/blog/bot-revolution), VtionSense. You can now search products online by chatting with [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot) on Telegram.

We find that people come across fashion items they like either on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp statuses or while walking down the street. They want to buy these fashion items but have no clue where and how to get them. We assume this happens to you everyday or probably right now. 

Welcome [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot), the first Telegram Visual Search bot that allows you to search with photos or even screenshots from Instagram. Simply send the picture of fashion outfit you're interested in and [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot) would immediately search through the product catalogs of our publishers and return similar/matching items. From a single click buy immediately.

To chat with [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot), download Telegram, search & add [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot) as a contact, and start searching. It's that easy.

If you are into retail fashion and interested in putting your products on [VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot), we will be opening the platform up help more retailers reach their customers faster in the coming weeks. Or [click here](https://evelyn157.typeform.com/to/njLRMH) to join the waiting list.

[VtionSense](https://t.me/VtionSenseBot) awaits you!!!

Happy shopping
