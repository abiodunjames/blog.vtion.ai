Beginning this week, we’re partnered with [Hadassah Bridals](https://hadassahbridals.com.ng) to test a new way to search for wedding gowns and accessories on Hadassah Bridals website right from your camera. We’re rolling it out slowly, but we wanted to announce it to everyone at the same time.

It’s super easy to use. Simply visit the Hadassah Bridals [visual search app (click here)](https://www.hadassahbridals.com.ng/visual-search), click the camera icon and point your camera at a wedding gown or select a picture from your phone to get started.

When the dress or accessory is recognized, we display search results available on Hadassah Bridals similar to what you searched for below the picture (for mobile) or beside the picture (for web). Tap your selection to view the product details, where you can add to cart and complete your purchase.

Hadassah Bridals has always been the best place to shop for wedding dresses, and now partnering with [vTion.ai](https://vtion.ai) is adding the fastest way to shop.

Happy shopping
